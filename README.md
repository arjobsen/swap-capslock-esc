# Use AutoHotkey to swap the Caps Lock and Esc key
_Why?_

Because Escape is used every day, every hour or maybe even more. And you'll rarely use Caps Lock. Unless you're a very angry person or a SQL developer. Your pinkie will thank you for putting the keys you use most closer together.

_How?_

Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) for Windows. Put SwapCapsLockEsc.ahk in %APPDATA%/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup to start the script automatically at boot.
